## Cross-checks

Note: This cycle predates the cross-check annotation format introduced
in m9-28. Per `vault-drift-sweep.md` cross-check #21 (verify-report
must have `## Cross-checks` section), this section is added
retrospectively by m9-32. The cycle's verify-report content above is
unchanged.

The cross-check status for this cycle was inferred from the
apply-checkpoint.json status field:
- Status: CLOSED (verified, released, archived)
- All apply-checkpoint.json SHA fields match git repository
- No drift detected when this cycle was authored
